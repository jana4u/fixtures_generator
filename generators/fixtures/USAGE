Description:
    Creates database fixtures for existing model. Pass the model name,
    either CamelCased or under_scored, and a list of attribute pairs
    as arguments.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes.

    This generates test fixtures in test/fixtures/table_name.yml.

    This generator is supposed to work with rake task db:fixtures:create,
    it is not supposed to be run manually.

Example:
    `./script/generate model post title:string body:text published:boolean`

    This will create fixtures for the Post model:
        Fixtures:   test/fixtures/posts.yml
